# Speed Cube Hub — Post-MVP Task List

Shared task board for multiple Claude sessions. All MVP tasks are complete.

## How to Use This File

**Before starting work:**
1. `git pull origin dev` to get the latest
2. Find a task that is `🔲 Available` with all dependencies `✅ Done`
3. Change status to `🏗️ In Progress` and add your identifier (e.g., `[Claude-A]`)
4. Commit and push the claim immediately

**When you finish a task:**
1. Change status to `✅ Done`
2. Commit and push your code + this file update together
3. Look for the next available task

**Rules:**
- Never start a task whose dependencies aren't all `✅ Done`
- Always pull before claiming
- Each task must result in a passing build (`npm run build`)
- Read the PRD and CLAUDE.md before starting any work

### T29: Badges & Credentials System

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | 🔲 Available |
| **Dependencies** | None |
| **Estimated scope** | SQL migrations (2 tables) + 2 server action files + 3 components + profile update |

A dedicated badges section on every profile. Three badge categories:

**1. Competition Credentials (admin-verified)**
Pre-defined badge types: World Record Holder, Continental Record Holder, National Record Holder, World Champion, Continental Champion, National Champion, World Finalist, National Finalist. Users claim a credential (e.g., "National Record Holder — 3x3, 2024"), it shows as "pending" until an admin approves it. Current record holders get a gold/highlighted badge; former holders get a visually muted version (`is_current` flag). Each badge dated by year.

**2. Sponsor Badge (self-reported)**
Users enter their sponsor name and it displays as a visually impressive badge on their profile. No admin approval needed — takes effect immediately.

**3. Practice Milestones (auto-awarded)**
Initial set: "First 100 Solves", "First 1,000 Solves", "7-Day Streak", "30-Day Streak", "100-Day Streak", "Practiced All 17 Events", "100 Hours Practiced". Auto-award logic runs after session logging. Future: badges for algorithm sets mastered, more hour/solve milestones.

**Implementation:**
- Create `badges` table (name, description, icon, category, tier, criteria_type, criteria_value, verification)
- Create `user_badges` table (user_id, badge_id, year, detail, is_current, verified, earned_at)
- Seed initial badge definitions
- Build server actions: `claimBadge()`, `getUserBadges()`, `getPublicBadges()`, `approveBadge()` (admin), `checkAndAwardMilestones()` (auto)
- Build `BadgesSection` component on profile (dedicated card/section with grid of earned badges)
- Build `ClaimBadgeModal` for users to claim competition credentials or add sponsor
- Build admin badge approval UI (admin-only)
